🚚 Delivery Request App — HackVyuha Winner 🏆
An innovative, real-time delivery request management system built during the HackVyuha National Hackathon — hosted by SRM AP University and GeeksForGeeks — where it proudly secured 1st Place.
The project combines a FastAPI backend and a Flutter (Dart) frontend with IoT capabilities to validate robot access codes and facilitate intelligent delivery flow.

🌟 Highlights
🥇 National Hackathon 1st Prize Winner
⚡ Fast, secure, and scalable REST API using FastAPI + JWT
📱 Sleek mobile frontend with Flutter
🤖 Raspberry Pi integration via TCP sockets for real-world robot validation
🔒 Access code verification for delivery bot control
💰 Seamless booking and payment flow
🌐 MongoDB for persistent user data
📦 Tech Stack
Layer	Technology	Description
Backend	FastAPI (Python)	Secure RESTful APIs, JWT Auth, TCP Comm
Frontend	Flutter (Dart)	Mobile UI/UX for end-users
Database	MongoDB	Stores users, sessions, metadata
IoT Comm	TCP Socket (Python)	Raspberry Pi control & communication
Auth	OAuth2 + JWT	Token-based login and session security
🛠 Features
🔐 Authentication
Register/Login with secure hashing (bcrypt)
JWT-based access tokens for authenticated sessions
📡 Robot Access Code
Generate & share a dynamic 6-digit code
Validate user input via backend call to Raspberry Pi (TCP)
Only allow delivery after code is successfully validated
📦 Delivery Booking
Users can book deliveries in a few taps
Select delivery slots and input destinations
💳 Payment Integration
Fake/mock payment screen to simulate real-world flow
🧾 Profile & Session Handling
Retrieve current user profile from JWT
Error handling for unauthorized access

🔧 Setup Instructions
💡 Backend (FastAPI)
Install Dependencies

pip install fastapi uvicorn pymongo python-jose[cryptography] passlib[bcrypt]
Run Backend

uvicorn main:app --reload
⚙ Ensure MongoDB is running locally (mongodb://localhost:27017)

📱 Frontend (Flutter)
Install Flutter (Guide)
Get Dependencies
flutter pub get
Run App
flutter run
🔒 API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/register	Register new user
POST	/login	Login and get JWT token
GET	/profile	Get user profile from token
GET	/get_code	Get current robot access code
POST	/verify	Verify access code via Raspberry Pi
🤖 Robot Access Code Logic
The FastAPI backend communicates with a Raspberry Pi over a TCP connection using a specific IP and port:

with socket.create_connection((PI_IP, PI_PORT), timeout=5) as s:
    s.sendall(code.encode())
    response = s.recv(1024).decode()
Expected reply:

"SUCCESS" — access granted
Any other — access denied
